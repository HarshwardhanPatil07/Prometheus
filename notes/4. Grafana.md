# Grafana
- To start grafana we need to do port forwading same as prometheus
![grafana-port-forward](/assests/grafana-port-forward.png)
- Default credentials when accessing the url user: admin, pwd: prom-operator

# Grafana Dashboard
- Dashboard is a set of one or more panels
- you can create your own dashboard
- organized into one or more rows
![grafana-dashboard-rows](/assests/grafana-dashboard-rows.png)
- row is a logical divider within a dashboard 
- rows are used to group panels together
# Panel 
- The basic visualization building block in Grafana (panel can have graph, table, etc)

- Composed by a query and a visualization

- Each panel has a query editor specific to the data source selected in the panel

- Can be moved and resized within a dashboard

## Structure summary 
- Folders -> Dashboards -> Rows -> Panels

- PromQL is query language for prometheus. you can edit the - by getting the data from prometheus and then grafana will use that data 

# Want to see Anomaly? Send requests to pod 
`kubectl run curl-test --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl -i --tty --rm` // busybox is used to send requests. so one pod is created which sends requests to the pod we want to hit the endpoint of.

- then write the script
```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10000)
do
curl http://a632b634927bb4d819a3ae1419e64f5f-271773390.eu-west-3.elb.amazonaws.com > test.txt
done
```
- `chmod +x test.sh`
- `./test.sh`

# Configure users and data sources
- u can configure that in configuration -> users

- Grafana knows on which endpoint want to communicate from data sources
