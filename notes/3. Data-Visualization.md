# What to monitor? What is the Goal?
- want to notice something unexpected happens
- Observe any anomalies (CPU Spikes, Insufficient storage, High Load, Unauthenticated requests)
- Analyze and react accordingly

# How do we get this information?
- Cluster Nodes? CPU RAM, Applications? No of Requests, k8s component? App Availability

# Prometheus UI
- since it has cluster ip i.e. internal service we will do port forwading `kubectl port-forward service/monitoring-kube-prometheus-prometheus -n monitoring 9090:9090 &` //& for running in background

# What targets is Prometheus monitoring?
- check by tapping status -> Targets 

# Prometheus Jobs
- status -> Configuration 
- in scrape configuration we have list of jobs 
![prometheus-job](/assests/prometheus-job.png)

- `Instance` = an endpoint you can scrape (in targets section do show more on one you can see endpoint)
- `Job` = Collection of Instances with the same purpose 
- Each endpoint has `Labels` which automatically get added/injected in that metrics
![prometheus-job-labels](prometheus-job-labels.png)
- with job name prometheus knows how to group them together(in img see job="apiserver")
![prometheus-job-labels-filter](prometheus-job-labels-filter.png)
- you can actually filter it based on different labels for a job
- every metric will also have instance label representing the endpoint instance from which metric was actually taken or scraped

## However Prometheus UI is not an Ideal tool for visualizing data to see anomalies for that we need Grafana
