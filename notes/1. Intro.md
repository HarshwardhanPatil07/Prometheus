# Why do we want to monitor?? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Monitor cluster nodes like cpu usage, resources, storage
- Manage k8s Components - Are all pods running? Are all microservices accessible?  
- Monitor third party applications like Redis (databases) - whether getting too many connections 
- Monitor own applications - How many errors? how many requests?

## Monitoring on different levels 
- Infrastructure level - CPU, RAM, Network, etc
- Platform Level - kubernetes components
- Application level - 3rd party and own applications

# Grafana is data visualization tool

# Now How to deploy the different parts in k8s cluster
- 1. Creating all configuration YAML files yourself and execute them in right order - Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager
- 2. Using an Operator - Manager of all prometheus components 
- 3. The most efficient Using Helm chart to deploy operator 

# Understanding prometheus stack components

- pod- from deployments and statefulSets , services- each component has its own
- 2 stateful sets - 1st Prometheus itself 2nd Alertmanager
- 3 deployments - 1st Prometheus Operator (created prometheus and Alertmanager statefulset), 2nd Grafana, 3rd kube state metrics (- own helm charts, - dependency of this helm chart, -scrapes k8s components)
- 3 replicaset - Created by Deployment 
- 1 DaemonSet -  Node Exporter DaemonSet
-- DaemonSet runs on every worker node 
-- Node Exporter connects to server translates worker node metrics(CPU Usage, load on server) to Prometheus metrics

## ConfigMaps `kubectl get configmap -n monitoring` 
- Configurations for different parts, managed by operator, how to connect to default metrics
## Secrets 
- for grafana, prometheus, operator, alert manager, certificates, username and passwords, etc
